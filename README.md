# B58Project

This is the CSCB58 final project, where I was required to create a platform game using MIPS assembly language. The goal of the game is to allow the player (displayed in a square) to reach the door on the top right corner by avoiding enemies and shooting bullets. To successfully pass the level, the player must have picked up the yellow key and collected the yellow coin, which would allow the opening of the door. Throughout the project, I used load/store instructions (lw, sw), arithmetic operations (add, addi, mult, etc.), and branch/jump instructions (beq, bgt, j, jal, etc.). This project took me 2-3 weeks time, and is an application of the assembly language fundamental knowledge learned in lecture. To run the code, open Mars.jar and load the game.asm, then before assembling, open the Keyboard and Display MMIO Simulator for keyboard control and Bitmap Display for displaying the game.

The following is a screenshot of the basic overview of the game:
